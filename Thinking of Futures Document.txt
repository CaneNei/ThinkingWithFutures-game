Thinking of futures Document

How to Play:
Only hardware needed is a computer and a mouse. (1920 x 1080 resolution recommended, but should work on all)
Left click to interact with NPC's and cards
Right click to move around the open areas
escape to pause game

During the open area's, talk to NPC's to collect cards which will be used later. Each NPC can only
be interacted with once so make sure you know if you want to collect or reject the card.

Level 1, you walk into the house door to progress to the battle
Level 2, you talk to the NPC on the stage 'principal' to progress to the battle
Level 3, you walk into a door of either one of the buildings to progress to the battle

Card battles are carried out by clicking and dragging the cards
click and hold on an attack card and drag and release onto the enemy you wish to attack
click and hold on a defensive card, drag and release onto yourself to activate

If stuck in card battles, aim to focus the spawns of the bosses.
